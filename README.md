## Understanding Barcelona's Population: An Exploratory Data Analysis
This is a capstone project for Hiperiondev Data Science Bootcamp.

The 'population.csv' data file was originally sourced from [the Open Data BCN portal](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en) and is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/barcelona-data-sets?select=population.csv).
The dataset provides comprehensive information on the population of Barcelona between 2013 and 2017, detailing its distribution across different age groups, genders, neighbourhoods, and districts. Through our analysis, we examine how the overall population of Barcelona has evolved during this period, investigate the demographic trends in various neighbourhoods and districts, and explore the gender proportions across different areas.
