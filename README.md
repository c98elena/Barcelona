## Exploratory Data Analysis of Barcelona's population.
This is a capstone project for Hiperiondev Datascience Bootcamp.

The data file 'population.csv' is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/barcelona-data-sets?select=population.csv), but originally sourced from [the Open Data BCN portal](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en). 
The data contains information about Barcelona's population for the years 2013-2017, including its distribution by age, gender, neighbourhood and district. We will analyse how the total population in Barcelona changed during these years, what the population is for different neighbourhoods and districts, and what the proportions are for the male and female population for different areas.
